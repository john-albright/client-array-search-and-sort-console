# Client Array Search and Sort 

This command line interface program was created to fulfill lab 4 of Oakton's CSC 241 Java Data Structures, a class I took in the spring of 2021 while working towards a [General Programmer Certificate](https://catalog.oakton.edu/career-programs-pathways/computer-information-systems/general-programmer-certificate/). A description of the course can be found in [the Computer Information Systems course descriptions list](https://catalog.oakton.edu/course-descriptions/course-descriptions-discipline/cis/). In addition, the course syllabus and lab 4's pdf for CIS 227 can be found in the course_info folder of the repository. The starter code for this assignment can be found in lab 4's pdf. 

The command line program can be run at [this Replit link](https://replit.com/@john-albright/client-array-search-and-sort-console).

The program allows the user to work with arrays populated with client names and numbers. There are three pathways: 
- search (S) 
- binary search (B) 
- modify (M)

The second pathway B has three other pathways: 
- A (java's built-in array sort)
- B (bubble sort)
- I (insertion sort)

The user is then asked to access the client using the name or number. The position on the roster and the client's name and number are returned to the console as well as the full roster (potentially sorted).
